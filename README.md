## Background - Analysis of CAZy database download file
[CAZy](cazy.org) is a database for carbohydrate active enzymes. 
It classifies proteins and predicted proteins into enzyme familes based on their amino acid sequence. 
A protein can contain multiple domains that may or may not belong to different enzyme families. The families are glycoside hydrolases (GH),glycosyltransferases (GT), polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate esterases (CE) and auxilary activities (AA). A special case of classification are the proteins classified as Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) which are not enzymes since they have no catalytic mechanim, but still provide important functions in carbohydrate degradation and therefor is included in the database. 

In this script we want to investigate the presence of multidomain or multicatalytic enzymes.
